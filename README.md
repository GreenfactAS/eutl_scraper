# eutl_scrapper

Routines to extract data from the EU Transaction Log ([EUTL](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/ets/)) that records compliance and transaction information for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS). The project implements several [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) spiders crawling the EUTL pages. Downloaded and cleaned data are available for download under [EUETS.INFO](https://euets.info).
